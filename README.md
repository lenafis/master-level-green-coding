# master-level-green-coding
This repository was created to save and update supporting material for my Master's thesis. A Master-level Green Coding was developed and implemented into Moodle. The course outlines can be found here. 

This repo contains the .mbz backup files for the individual courses which can be imported by system admins into any Moodle instance. The outlines are (without some exceptions) not filled with final content and only offer the backbone of the courses. 


Enjoy Master-level Green Coding! :)
