# Master-Level Green Coding

This repository was created to save and update supporting material for my Master's thesis where a Master-level Green Coding curriculum was developed and implemented into the e-learning platform Moodle. The course outlines can be found here. 

## Course Import
This repo contains the `.mbz` backup files for the individual courses which can be imported by system admins into any Moodle instance. The outlines are (with some exceptions) not filled with final content and only offer the backbone of the courses. 
To import the files please follow this path in your Moodle instance: Site administration > Courses > Restore Course

## Competency Framework Import
This repo also contains the competency framework as a `.csv` file. 
To import it, please follow this path in your Moodle instance: Site administration > General > Competencies > Import Competency Framework

Enjoy Master-Level Green Coding! 🌿
